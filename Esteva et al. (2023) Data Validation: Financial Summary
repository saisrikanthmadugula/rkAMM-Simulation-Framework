Esteva et al. (2023) Data Validation: Financial Summary

The following results were generated by running our framework's PricingAgent (rkAMM) and BlockchainEnforcementAgent against the 10,000-invoice dataset from the Esteva et al. (2023) GitHub repository.


The dataset consists of 10,000 loans:

4,000 loans with a 1% probability of default (p_d = 0.01)

6,000 loans with a 30% probability of default (p_d = 0.30)


Scenario 1: 0% Collateralization (C=0.0)

Total Premiums Collected: 2,612.04

Total Defaults (Simulated): 1,840

Total Losses Paid: 1,840.00

NET PROFIT/LOSS: +772.04


Scenario 2: 60% Collateralization (C=0.6)

Total Premiums Collected: 1,044.82

Total Defaults (Simulated): 1,840

Total Losses Paid: 736.00

NET PROFIT/LOSS: +308.82


Conclusion

In both scenarios, the rkAMM pricing mechanism—when applied to the foundational paper's dataset—successfully collected enough premiums to cover all simulated default losses, resulting in a net profit for the liquidity pool. This validates the core pricing engine of our integrated framework.
