Running Dynamic MAS-rkAMM Simulation...
Model: 500 borrowers, 20 loans each.
Total Transactions: 10000
Dynamic simulation complete.

--- Analysis of Plots ---
Plot 1 (Left): Check for the bimodal distribution (peaks ~45 and ~78).
  This shows the 'virtuous' and 'vicious' cycles separating borrowers.

Plot 2 (Right): Check for the downward trend in required collateral.
  This demonstrates the 'virtuous cycle' in action.

Model Validation:
  Avg. collateral change after 1 successful repayment: -2.37%
  (This value can be tuned by adjusting the REPAY_BUMP constant in the script).
